Creating a timed code quiz for module 3 project 

With this module challenge we were given a set of instructions to follow for a successful coding quiz: 
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
-SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and my score
- (reference GIF)

Some of the challenges I had with this module were figuring out what needed to be where, since there were so many elements, and it was difficult for me to determine which needed to be where. After scratching the code and trying different approaches, I was able to build on each of the functions needed to start the time, display the question, deduct time, and add scoring.
